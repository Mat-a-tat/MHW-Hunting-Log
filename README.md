# Monster Hunter World Iceborne Hunting Log 
 
In a connected Google Sheets document using [Pygsheets](https://github.com/nithinmurali/pygsheetspygsheets) , search by weapon to determine what monsters you have yet to fill out for in relation to that weapon, with an optional region being selected. Writes directly to individual cells of a monster and weapon. Generates base formating for a fresh document. 

The game features 14 weapon, all with (usually) distinct playstyles, and 65 differnet monsters all with (usually) distinct movesets. This tool was created assist with catalouging my journey in fighting every monster, with every weapon in the game, and recording my experiance of the fight afterwards. It became rather cumbersome to lookup individual cells within exell for every fight, and while it was possible to generate logs using sheets; I found that process to be even more cumbersome. As such, I designated this as my capstone project for my completion of CS50P. 

This project, however, is still rather unwealdy. It requires the prior generation and authenitcation of security keys through Google, and passing of those keys through the program itself. As such it presents a **security risk** to any unfamilair with using service acocunts or your the method of authentication, thus caution is advised.
